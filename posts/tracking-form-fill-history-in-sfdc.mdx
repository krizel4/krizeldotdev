title: Tracking Form Fill History in Salesforce
description: How to Capture Every UTM and Form Interaction for Better Attribution
---

When it comes to multi-touch attribution and campaign reporting and attribution, having a clear record of every form fill is essential. Ideally we'd like to accomplish this without overwriting previous information, especially if a teams' KPI is to track form fills each month.

This solution was adapted from Jenna Molby's [UTM Touchpoint Solution](https://thespotforpardot.com/2021/09/10/how-to-capture-every-utm-touchpoint-in-salesforce). In this solution, I discuss the addition of maintaining records when a lead converts to a contact record and other use cases for the custom object.

By using two Record-Triggered Flows — one on the Lead object and one on the Contact object — this system automatically logs every new form submission into a custom “Form Fill” object.

Each record may capture UTM parameters, timestamps, and other contextual form details - whether that's offering more granularity to your reporting or even creating smart lists based on product interests. 

## Purpose of Form Fill Flows
Together, the two flows serve as a bridge between marketing attribution and CRM data hygiene:

* **Lead Flow** (*Form Fill Dates – Lead*)\
Runs when a Lead is created or updated. It captures form submissions, UTMs, and last-form details before the record is converted.

* **Contact Flow** (*Form Fill Dates – Contact or Converted from Lead*)\
Runs when a Contact is created (new conversion) or updated. It checks for duplicates and logs form fills post-conversion.

## Business Use Cases

This configuration enables multiple operational and analytical benefits:

1. **Attribution Tracking**\
Capture UTM Source, Medium, Campaign, and Content for each submission to support first-touch, last-touch, or multi-touch models.

2. **Conversion History**\
Maintain a detailed log of every form interaction even after a Lead is converted to a Contact — avoiding data loss during lead conversion.

3. **Form Engagement Reporting**\
Report on which campaigns, forms, or landing pages generate the most submissions over time.

4. **Campaign Optimization**\
Use historical form data to identify engagement trends, content effectiveness, and conversion lag by campaign or source.

5. **Data Hygiene and Deduplication**\
Prevent duplicate form fills and redundant records through decision logic built directly into the flow.
